# Submission - Lemmization and Stop words

## Why am I doing this
The model might be better able to hone into features if I focus it into things like the word count etc

## Implementation Notes
Wrote a lemmazation method and passed that as a tokenizer argument to tdidf


## Outcome
The model scored .94 which is even worse than before
